## 🖥️ Backend API Features & Implementation

### FastAPI Architecture & Endpoints
```python
# Core endpoints
GET /                    # API status and version info
GET /health             # Health check with timestamp
POST /api/detect        # Image upload & ingredient detection
POST /api/recipes       # Recipe generation from ingredients
GET /docs               # Interactive Swagger documentation
```

### Ingredient Detection Service (`/api/detect`)
**Functionality:**
- **Image Validation**: Check file format (JPEG/PNG)
- **Image Processing**: Basic processing using Pillow
- **Mock YOLO Recognition**: Simulate AI vision model
- **Response**: 4-8 random ingredients with confidence scores (0.7-0.95)
- **Processing Time**: Simulate real AI processing delay (1.5 seconds)

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Key backend features
- FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI docs
- CORS middleware for iOS cross-origin requests  
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Multipart file upload handling
- Comprehensive error responses
- Mock AI processing with realistic delays

async def detect_ingredients(image: UploadFile):
    # Image validation and processing
    # Mock YOLO simulation
    # Structured JSON response
```

### Recipe Generation Service (`/api/recipes`)
**Functionality:**
- **Input Parameters**: Ingredient list, meal type, dietary restrictions, preferred cuisine
- **Mock LLM Generation**: Create structured recipes based on input
- **Complete Recipe**: Ingredients, steps, nutrition, tags
- **Customized Content**: Adjust content based on user preferences
- **Processing Time**: Simulate LLM processing time (2 seconds)

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Recipe generation logic
class RecipeRequest(BaseModel):
    ingredients: List[str]
    mealCraving: str
    dietaryRestrictions: List[str] = []
    preferredCuisine: str = "Any"

def generate_mock_recipe(request: RecipeRequest) -> Recipe:
    # Dynamic recipe creation based on detected ingredients
    # Structured instruction generation with timing and tips
    # Nutrition information calculation
    # Tag generation based on cuisine and meal type
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
iOS App Request → FastAPI Validation → Mock AI Processing → Structured Response
Image Upload → Pillow Processing → YOLO Simulation → Ingredient JSON
Recipe Request → Parameter Validation → LLM Simulation → Complete Recipe JSON
```

## 🔄 Mock AI Services Implementation

### YOLO Ingredient Detection Simulation
**Technical Details:**
- Predefined pool of 15 common ingredients
- Random selection of 4-8 ingredients per request
- Confidence score generation (0.7-0.95 range)
- Realistic processing time simulation (asyncio.sleep)

```python
MOCK_INGREDIENTS = [
    "Tomatoes", "Bell Peppers", "Onions", "Carrots", "Broccoli",
    "Cheese", "Milk", "Eggs", "Chicken Breast", "Garlic",
    # ... more ingredients
]

# Simulation logic
detected_count = random.randint(4, 8)
detected_ingredients = random.sample(MOCK_INGREDIENTS, detected_count)
confidence_scores = [round(random.uniform(0.7, 0.95), 2) for _ in detected_ingredients]
```

### LLM Recipe Generation Simulation  
**Technical Details:**
- Recipe creation based on detected ingredients
- Dynamic content adjustment based on meal type
- Complete cooking instruction generation
- Nutrition information and practical cooking tips

```python
def generate_mock_recipe(request: RecipeRequest) -> Recipe:
    # Use detected ingredients as base
    # Create structured ingredients with measurements
    # Generate step-by-step instructions with timing
    # Add nutrition facts and cooking tips
    # Tag categorization based on cuisine and preferences
```
