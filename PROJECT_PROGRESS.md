# Kitchen Assistant - Project Progress Report

## Current Status:

1. Developed a food ingredient detection pipeline using YOLOv8n pre-trained model deployed on FastAPI backend (localhost:8000), enabling users to upload images and receive instant ingredient recognition through the /api/detect API endpoint.
2. I also tried finetune Yolov8n model on food101 dataset, but my computer(Mac M3) had been shut down when I trained model, so I will try different dataset like food101-tiny.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **YOLOv8n Pretrained Model Integration**
- **Model**: Downloaded `yolov8n.pt` (6.2MB) and placed in `backend/` directory
- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8n for object detection
- **Device Support**: MPS (M3)
- **Classes**: 80 COCO classes including food items (apple, banana, pizza, donut, etc.)


### 2. **Image Upload & Detection Pipeline**
```
User Upload → FastAPI → YOLO Model → Filtered Results → JSON Response
```

#### Data Flow:
1. **User Upload**: UIImage → Data (JPEG/PNG)
2. **Backend Processing**: UploadFile → bytes → PIL.Image
3. **YOLO Inference**: PIL.Image → List[Results] with boxes, confidence, classes
4. **Food Filtering**: Extract food-related classes only
5. **Response**: DetectionResponse (ingredients, confidence, processing_time)
